# JMX-to-web bridge install libmx4j-java and uncomment the following.
#EXTRA_CLASSPATH="/usr/share/java/mx4j-tools.jar"

# Control how cassandra is started:
#    - org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon - normally
#    - org.apache.cassandra.service.ElassandraDaemon - with elasticsearch enabled
